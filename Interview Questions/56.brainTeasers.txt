Techniques
	* Develop patterns and rules




Example 1. You have two ropes, and each takes exactly one hour to burn. How would you use them
to time exactly 15 minutes? Note that the ropes are of uneven densities, so half the rope
length-wise does not necessarily take half an hour to burn.

	If we burn one rope, it takes 1 hour.
	If we burn one rope, and then the other one, it will take 2 hours.
	If we burn a rope in both ends, it takes 30 minutes to burn.
	So we can measure 30 minutes.

	We can burn one rope at both ends, and the other one at one end. Rope 1 will burn 30 minutes later.
	We can the burn the other end of the second rope, so it will measure half the time. This way you can measure 15 minutes.

Example 2. You have nine balls. Eight are of the same weight, and one is heavier. 
You are given a balance which tells you only whether the left side or the right side is heavier. 
Find the heavy ball in just two uses of the scale
	
	If we divide in 3 sets of 3, and then compare two sets, we know which set has the heavy one.
	If we have a set of 3, we can compare two balls. This will tell us which is the heaviest.

Example 3. You have 20 bottles of pills. 19 bottles have 1.0 gram pills, but one has pills of weight 1.1 grams. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once


	20 bottles of pills
		* 19 weight 1 gram
		* 1 weights 1.1 grams

	You can only use the scale once
		* If we put 1, it is based on luck
		* If we put 10, we can discard half.
		* We need to put more than one pill

	We can put i pills for each i bottle.
		* 1 for b1, 2 for b2, 3 for b3
		* If b1 is heavier, 6.1, 
		* If b2 is heavier 6.2
		* If b3 is heavier, 6.3
		* We expected 6. So 6.1-6= 0.1 That is for bottle 11

	Expected weight: 210 grams
	We take weight-expected. We multiply that by 10. This gives us the result


Example 4. You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water
(but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of
water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half"of
the jug would be impossible

	* Fill the five-quart jug 	(5 0)
	* Fill the three-quart jug with the water of the 5	(2 3)
	* Clear the 3 (2 0)
	* From 5 to 3 (0 2)
	* Fill 5 (5 2)
	* From 5 to 3 (4 2)
