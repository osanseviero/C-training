Example 1. You have two ropes, and each takes exactly one hour to burn. How would you use them
to time exactly 15 minutes? Note that the ropes are of uneven densities, so half the rope
length-wise does not necessarily take half an hour to burn.

	If we burn one rope, it takes 1 hour.
	If we burn one rope, and then the other one, it will take 2 hours.
